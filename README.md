# Project Overview

This project serves as a recreational endeavor to practice API usage and become familiar with scenarios where data may not be available. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to refine JSX writing skills and enhance the ability to read it more quickly.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the result. Begin editing the page by modifying pages/index.js, and the page will auto-update as you make changes.

### The PokéAPI (Pokémon API

The PokéAPI (Pokémon API) is a free and open RESTful web service that provides comprehensive information about Pokémon. It serves as a centralized repository for Pokémon-related data, allowing developers to access details about Pokémon species, abilities, types, evolutions, and more.

Here are some key features and aspects of the PokéAPI:

Endpoint-Based Structure: The PokéAPI follows a well-organized and endpoint-based structure. Different endpoints provide information about different aspects of Pokémon, such as /pokemon for details about individual Pokémon species, /ability for abilities, /type for Pokémon types, and so on.

RESTful Design: It adheres to RESTful principles, making it easy for developers to make HTTP requests and retrieve JSON-formatted data.

Comprehensive Data: The API contains a vast amount of data related to Pokémon, including information about individual Pokémon, their abilities, types, evolutions, forms, and more. This makes it a valuable resource for projects related to Pokémon, such as games, apps, or websites.

Free and Open: The PokéAPI is free to use and open to the public, making it accessible for developers who want to integrate Pokémon-related data into their projects.

Documentation: The PokéAPI provides detailed documentation that outlines the available endpoints, request parameters, response structures, and usage guidelines. This documentation makes it easy for developers to understand how to interact with the API effectively.
